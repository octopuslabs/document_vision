# Computer Vision Swift Sample

This app demonstrates how to use the [OpenCV library](http://opencv.org/) to run real-time document edges detection on current camera image.

## Prerequisites
- Bit of theory on Canny edge detector
  [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)
- An OSX machine or emulator
- [Xcode 7][xcode]
- Install [CocoaPods][cocoapods] if you don't have it already by running the command `sudo gem install cocoapods`.
	- You'll need to have [RubyGems][rubygems] installed in order to install CocoaPods.

## Quickstart
- Clone this repo and `cd` into the `Swift` directory.
- `cd` into the `Swift` directory and install the `open CV` pod by running `pod install`.
- Open the project by running `open imagepicker.xcworkspace`.
- Build and run the app.


## Running the app

- Press `start capture` button, and see the red frame detecting your document edges.
